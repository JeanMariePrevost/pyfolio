# Pyfolio - Easy Portfolio Websites

**Pyfolio** is a Python-based tool, powered by Flask, designed to help you create simple, customizable portfolio websites effortlessly.

This tool automatically generates a portfolio gallery and pages by detecting matching image, audio and video files and text files. Pyfolio can also bake a static version of your site instead of running as a web app, ready to be hosted on any web hosting service.

You can try a demo at the following:

## Getting Started

### 1. Add Your Files
Place your images, audio, and video files in the `/portfolio/` directory.

### 2. Customize Portfolio Item Pages
For any asset, add a Markdown file with the same name to include additional content.  
Example:  
`/portfolio/my_picture.jpg` â†’ `/portfolio/my_picture.md`

### 3. Create or Modify Pages
To add or edit pages, work with the Markdown files in `/custom_pages/`.  
Example:  
`/custom_pages/about.md` creates a new "About" page.

### 4. Define Navigation and Footer Links
Edit the `config.toml` file to configure links for the navigation bar and footer.  
Example for a top navigation link:
```
[[top_link]]
label = "Portfolio"
target = "portfolio.md"
```
Example for a footer link:
```
[[footer_link]]
label = "Privacy Policy"
target = "privacy.md"
```

### 5. Run Pyfolio
To start the Pyfolio server:
```bash
python app.py
```
To generate a static version of your portfolio:
```bash
python bake_website.py
```
The static site will be saved in `/bake_website_output/`.

### 6. View Your Portfolio
- **Local Server**: Open your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
- **Static Site**: Open `index.html` in `/bake_website_output/`.
- **Deployment**: Host Pyfolio on platforms like Heroku, pythonanywhere, or your own server.
